THE SITUATION:
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing the movie rental company. 
He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. 
His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.
